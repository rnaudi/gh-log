Generate tab-completion scripts for your shell.

The script is output on `stdout`, allowing you to redirect the output to
the file of your choosing. Where you place the file will depend on which
shell, and which operating system you are using. Your particular
configuration may also determine where these scripts need to be placed.

Here are some common setups for the supported shells under Unix and
similar operating systems (such as GNU/Linux).

BASH:

Completion files are commonly stored in `/etc/bash_completion.d/` for
system-wide commands, but can be stored in
`~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions` for user-specific commands.

Run the command:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions
    $ gh-log completions bash > ~/.local/share/bash-completion/completions/gh-log

This installs the completion script. You may have to log out and log
back in to your shell session for the changes to take effect.

BASH (macOS/Homebrew):

Homebrew stores bash completion files within the Homebrew directory.
With the `bash-completion` brew formula installed, run the command:

    $ mkdir -p $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d
    $ gh-log completions bash > $(brew --prefix)/etc/bash_completion.d/gh-log

ZSH:

ZSH completions are commonly stored in any directory listed in your
`$fpath` variable. To use these completions, you must either add the
generated script to one of those directories, or add your own to this list.

Adding a custom directory is often the safest bet if you are unsure of
which directory to use. First create the directory; for this example
we'll create a hidden directory inside our `$HOME` directory:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.zsh/completions

Then add the following lines to your `.zshrc` just before `compinit`:

    fpath=(~/.zsh/completions $fpath)

Now you can install the completions script using the following command:

    $ gh-log completions zsh > ~/.zsh/completions/_gh-log

You must then restart your shell or run:

    $ exec zsh

for the new completions to take effect.

FISH:

Fish completion files are commonly stored in
`$HOME/.config/fish/completions`. Run the command:

    $ mkdir -p ~/.config/fish/completions
    $ gh-log completions fish > ~/.config/fish/completions/gh-log.fish

This installs the completion script. You may have to log out and log
back in to your shell session for the changes to take effect.

POWERSHELL:

The PowerShell completion scripts require PowerShell v5.0+ (which comes
with Windows 10, but can be downloaded separately for Windows 7 or 8.1).

First, check if a profile has already been set:

    PS C:\> Test-Path $profile

If the above command returns `False` run the following:

    PS C:\> New-Item -path $profile -type file -force

Now open the file provided by `$profile` (if you used the `New-Item`
command it will be
`${env:USERPROFILE}\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1`)

Next, we either save the completions file into our profile, or into a
separate file and source it inside our profile. To save the completions
into our profile simply use:

    PS C:\> gh-log completions powershell >> $profile

CUSTOM LOCATIONS:

Alternatively, you could save these files to the place of your choosing,
such as a custom directory inside your $HOME. Doing so will require you
to add the proper directives, such as `source`ing inside your login
script. Consult your shell's documentation for how to add such directives.
